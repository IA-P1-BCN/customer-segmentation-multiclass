# AI Activity Log

## Purpose

This document maintains a chronological record of significant AI-assisted work performed in the project.

Its purpose is to help team members understand previous activities, identify completed work and continue tasks without losing context.

## Logging Guidelines

- Record significant work sessions, not every individual interaction.
- Keep entries concise, factual and understandable.
- Distinguish between proposed, implemented and verified changes.
- Record actual commands and test results when relevant.
- Identify files created or modified.
- Never fabricate activities, results or completed tasks.
- Never include credentials, API keys, tokens or other secrets.
- Preserve previous entries. Never overwrite or delete historical records.

## Activity Records

### A-001 — Agent skills setup and project governance documentation

- **Date:** 2026-11-11
- **Agent:** opencode (GLM model), Skills CLI (`npx skills`)
- **Human owner:** Pending assignment (to be filled by the team)
- **Objective:** Evaluate, select and version shared AI agent skills for the Python/ML project, and establish project governance documentation (AGENTS.md + AI usage logs).
- **Activities:**
  - Searched and evaluated `mattpocock/skills` (38 skills found; global install of 2 TypeScript skills later ruled out as irrelevant).
  - Verified OpenCode 1.19.5 skill discovery from `.agents/skills` and the skills-lock.json restore procedure (`skills experimental_install --dry-run`).
  - Excluded unselected skills from the project installation; installed 4 approved skills project-locally (`tdd`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `code-review`, `research`); regenerated `skills-lock.json` (4 entries). Recorded as D-001 (Approved).
  - Created AGENTS.md (5 sections), restructured it from 208 to 65 lines per approved proposal, and added section 5 (Technical Standards and Reproducibility) with team-approved wording fixes.
  - Created `docs/ai-usage/DECISION_LOG.md` and `AI_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` templates; registered D-001.
- **Files:** Created: `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/{tdd,diagnosing-bugs,code-review,research}/`, `skills-lock.json`, `docs/ai-usage/DECISION_LOG.md`, `docs/ai-usage/AI_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
- **Verification:** `npx skills ls --json` (4 skills registered to OpenCode); dry-run restore from lock confirmed; `git status` inspected after each task.
- **Outcome:** Completed.
- **Pending tasks:** Skills `pr`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets` deferred pending tooling decisions; nothing committed yet (awaiting team authorization).

### A-002 — Repository review, EDA review and test-set decision

- **Date:** 2026-11-11 / 2026-11-12
- **Agent:** Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5)
- **Human owner:** Rita Pereira
- **Objective:** Review the repository setup and Pedro's EDA notebook; update the documentation after the team decided not to use `Test.csv`.
- **Activities:**
  - Reviewed AGENTS.md, AI usage logs, installed skills, `.gitignore` and git history (read-only).
  - Compared `Train.csv` and `Test.csv` with a Python `csv` script: 2,332 of 2,627 Test IDs also appear in Train with different values; class distributions differ.
  - Ran `git pull` on `main` (fast-forward to `75374d9`, PR #40).
  - Reviewed `01_eda_inicial.ipynb` on `origin/feature/eda-pedro` (read-only, not executed). Findings shared with the team: the 70/15/15 split described in the notebook is not in its code (analysis runs on all 8,068 rows); one code cell is stored as Markdown; one cell not executed; duplicated cells; out-of-order execution.
  - On human request, created branch `docs/discard-external-test-csv`, updated AGENTS.md (§1 data rules, §5 validation line) and README, and proposed D-006. Clarified with the team owner that an initial basic EDA on the full `Train.csv` is descriptive only, and reflected this in AGENTS.md and D-006.
  - Checked `Train.csv` for duplicates (Python `csv` script): 417 rows are exact duplicates of another row ignoring `ID`; 734 rows repeat another row's features. Not yet decided how to handle them before the split.
  - `git fetch --prune`: `origin/develop` points to the same commit as `main` (`75374d9`); no new work besides `feature/eda-pedro`.
- **Files:** Modified: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ai-usage/DECISION_LOG.md`, `docs/ai-usage/AI_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
- **Verification:** `git status` / `git diff` inspected; no code or tests to run.
- **Outcome:** Documentation changes implemented. D-006 is Proposed (not approved).
- **Pending tasks:** Human approval of D-006; open and review the PR; decide how to handle duplicates; implement the 70/15/15 split in `src/` with a pinned `requirements.txt`; clarify the role of the `develop` branch.
